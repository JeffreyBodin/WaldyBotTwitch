WaldyBot: A twitch bot.

## Introduction

WaldyBotTwitch is in early development. It consists of WaldyBot's "Amazon-Twitch integration". 

This build will either continue its separate, but connected development path. Or, continue development after switching to an eventual gradual merging with the master discord-bot. 
Its also fairly possible that WaldyBot will fully absorb WaldyBotTwitch's functionality. Without any currently planned "official" merging of either. Which seems the likely course of action considering WaldyBotTwitch's latest alpha-release. 

My hindrance is efficiency/engineering concerns associated with combining the two currently separate branches of WaldyBot. Notably at my level of engineering competence.
